                why does it take so long to load?
            </h2>
            <p>
                in order to find the most stat-efficient combinations, the algorithm needs to sort through
                every possible combination (up to 6 items!) while also applying factors like bonus stats from passives
                (for instance the 3% power -> mana bonus from Transcendance). A faster "greedy" algorithm that only
                tries to find the best stat items one at a time may not actually produce the most optimal result due to
                this. i wrote this generator specifically to experiment with the new ratatoskr acorns synergy with other
                tanky items<br>
                if you want to speed up your search times, try adding in a few items manually before starting. Each item
                multiplicatively speeds up the search. the search sorts its results as it operates, only holding onto
                the amount of results you specify while it works - so it doesn't eat up inane amounts of ram generating
                every possibility. you can safely set the value to some really high values without a speed impact

                if you want you can <button class="btn-xs btn-link" onclick="Notification.requestPermission()" href="">
                    enable
                    notification
                    access</button>, and
                the site will ping you when the search is done
            </p>
            <h2>
                does this actually generate 'optimal' builds?
            </h2>
            <p>
                no not really. there are a few notable things about how this generates results:
            <ul>
                <li> only passive effects that augment stats are reflected in the data, though it shows passives for
                    easier reference. So some items which have good utility through their passive will simply be skipped
                    since the system doesnt really have a way of
                </li>
                <li> item stats are imagined in a 'best case' scenario: meaning they are fully stacked and have an
                    active passive when it meaningfully impacts stats. for instance, stone cutting sword is stored at
                    having 30 def + 30 pen, though that is not technically an accurate representation of the item
                </li>
                <li> so far not every stat is tracked by search as 'useful' even if they would have an impact on
                    dps/sustain in game. updates should fix this over time and allow for more granularity in the search.
                    there are some stats that are hard to account for in the search without injecting too much 'opinion'
                    to the formulas - for example currently the item data does not track hp5/mp5 at all, and lifesteal
                    will likely be considered as a 'utility' stat in the future
                </li>
                <li> there is a bit of correction in place currently for 'stat caps' - mostly relating to dmg output,
                    though it will show you how much each stat is without the cap when the search is done
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>
                what are 'effective hp' and 'relative score'?
            </h2>
            <p>
                your effective hp is a figure representing <strong>how much damage</strong> it would take to kill you,
                accounting for both your hp and your armors. when sorting for high defense stats, the system uses these
                rather than the raw protection stats of the items. for example, at 100 armor, you negate 50% of damage
                taken (of that type) - so if you have 1500 hp, your effective health is 3000. this is why there are two
                numbers: red(first) is physical, blue(second) is magical. you can read more about
                damage scaling in the wondrously comprehensive <a
                    href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ow_ls0iB2wi2jbgU1FZv7RWWbqRDBGpt/view">word of thoth</a> for
                which the formula was derived from
                <br><br>
                the 'relative score' of a build does not mean much actually. its simply a value generated for the build
                while sorting based off the parameters of the search. its not a description of how 'objectively good' a
                build is or isn't - rather how well it matches the parameters of the search. the same build can have
                drastically different scores if you provided different search criteria

            </p>
            <h2>
                will this site get support for other smite characters?
            </h2>
            <p>
                in a sense the framework for it is already in place - so it could be likely. my plan is to do more work
                for now on ratatoskr specific models, such as estimating damage from auto-attack chains and abilities,
                to give a more realistic view of the damage output for the character. it would be way too much on my own
                to try and model that for even a few other characters, let alone all the others, especially considering
                the fact that i (personally) dont have an interest in playing any other character. ratatoskrs new acorns
                also have the benefit of allowing him to have a faster overall search time, since one item slot only has
                4 options. if
                you are currently using this site to test builds for other physical dmg characters, please note that the
                stat totals listed <strong>include</strong> the lvl.20 base stats for ratatoskr (def: 72,
                mdf: 48,
                mit: 0,
                hp: 1880,
                mana: 1060)<br><br>
                right now the app isnt connected to the smite api database to retrieve item info since the way data is
                stored is 'opinionated'. so adding support for other characters / classes is largely a matter of the
                data formatting necessary to get them usable by the algorithm. if you wanna help add more data, or look
                at my terrible, strenuous sorting system, feel free to reach out on the project <a
